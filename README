I know, seriously.  The 8051.  Im really not that old, maybe but not
"that" old.  The 8051s from dallas semi when they were still dallas
semi were the second MCU I really got into, started on a PIC then moved
to the Dallas TINI board.  Actually wrote a UDP/IP stack or enough of
one, in 8051 assembly.

Mostly because of the market, but I have been doing a lot of ARM
chips and there are only so many vendors and their peripherals are
almost identical within a vendor so felt like a change.  Have been
playing with eagle pcb for very very simple boards, using oshpark
to build them.  So for a few bucks you can evaluate different things.
Ordered a few different non-arm's, mostly older instruction sets to
play with, and one is an 8051.  Something I have used, but not for
many years.

The 8051 is long from dead, I know it is still actively used in some
macs and phys, and likely other places.  You might have something in
or plugged into your computer now that has one.   Still for every one
of these or for every x86 you probably have dozens of ARMs of which
only a small percentage you know about.

Anyway the 8051 has had a very very long life moving from intel
to dallas to now si labs as the big name in that family, and probably
others along the way or in parallel that I am not familiar with.
