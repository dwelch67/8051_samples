I got a AT89LP214-20XU part.  Go to http://atmel.com and search
for that part number (should find AT89LP214) and get the datasheet.

I had some tssop-20 breakout boards made and this part fit on there
fine even though it is 14 pins.  For lack of a better name see hello.brd
and hello.pdf.  I use http://oshpark.com to build boards.

Atmel has a simple spi protocol, not unlike the one used on the AVR
parts.  You need a four wire spi, and assert reset.

1 P1.5 MOSI     14 P1.6 MISO
2 P1.7 SCK      13 P1.4 SS
3 P1.3 RST      12 P1.1
4 GND           11 P1.0
5 P1.2          10 VCC
6 P3.0 RXD      9  P3.1 TXD
7 P3.2          8  P3.3

As the datasheet says you need at a minimum to control these pins.
