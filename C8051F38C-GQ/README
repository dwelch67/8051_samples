I got a couple of these Silicon Labs C8051F38C-GQ parts.  Just search
for C8051F38C-GQ at http:www.silabs.com for the datasheet and any
other documentation.

I got loose parts and soldered them to this very simple LQFP32_breakout
board.  The brd file is in this repo and a pdf of what it looks like.
Cost under $2 a board at https://oshpark.com, can probably find cheaper
ones elsewhere.

Hand soldering these parts is not difficult at all if you have good
enough tools.  I keep threatening to make some videos or something and
on some of these repos have long winded descriptions.  Basically I use
clear tape over half the part leaving at least one full side exposed
looking through the tape to align all the pins to pads.  then you can
blob solder on the pins, okay if there are solder bridges, then use
a wick to carefully absorb all that you can, there is still enough left
under the legs to do the job.  repeat for the other sides.  may not
need the tape after the first side but I reuse it to hold the board
to the work surface until done.  I did lose the first part I tried to
being too rough with the wick sliding it against the pins instead of
with, even better dont slide it at all, just pick it up as you move
the iron before it attaches to anything.  Remember not to handle the
wick with your fingers, the oils dont help the solder being absorbed
by it.

Looks like application note an127 defines the C2 protocol which is a
two wire protocol that can be used to program these things.  I will
use some other mcu to do this (or maybe bit bang it with an ftdi
breakout).


1 p0.1
2 p0.0
3 GND
4 D+
5 D-
6 VDD
7 REGIN
8 VBUS
    9 10 11

    9  !RST/C2CK
    10 P3.0/C2D

Interesting, it is a built in regulator, for use in USB applications
(on my bucket list), can feed 5V into REGIN, then VDD becomes a 3.3v
output OR dont use REGIN and feed 3.3v into VDD.  Going with the
3.3v from an ftdi breakout board, into VDD and GND to GND.
